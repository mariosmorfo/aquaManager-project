# Aquaculture Management UI

A lightweight Angular application designed for managing aquaculture production tasks including cage creation, fish stocking, and mortality registration.

This project is part of a front-end technical task. It offers a user-friendly interface with client-side persistence and input validation, built using Angular and Angular Material.

---

## Features Implemented (Requirements 1–3)

### 1. Cage Management

- View a dynamic table of cages
- Add new cages with autogenerated names
- Rename cages inline via input fields
- Delete cages by row

### 2. Fish Stocking

- Select a stocking date
- Enter number of fish to stock per cage
- Prevents negative or empty entries
- Rejects submission if all values are zero or null
- Saves stocking records to `localStorage` using date keys

### 3. Mortality Registration

- Select a stocking date
- Shows only cages that had fish stocked on that date
- Allows input of dead fish per cage
- Enforces these validations:
  - Cannot register mortalities for cages with no stocking
  - Cannot register negative numbers
  - Cannot exceed the number of stocked fish
- Outputs validation errors via `alert()` and logs valid records to console

## Architecture

- **Framework**: Angular v20
- **Routing**: Configured in `app.routes.ts`
- **UI**: Angular Material (`mat-table`, `mat-form-field`, `datepicker`, etc.)
- **State Management**: `CageService` holds cage state in memory

## ChatGPT

Some parts of this project were developed with the help of ChatGPT (OpenAI) as a technical assistant. It was used to clarify and resolve specific logic and implementation challenges, including:

Simplifying complex conditional validation in the mortality submission logic.

Designing clean localStorage key strategies for date-based stocking data.

Refactoring nested if statements into clearer early-return structures.

This README was written with the assistance of ChatGPT to help summarize the project structure, logic, and usage clearly.
